- Hi, Iâ€™m @iyervarsha12, currently doing my Masters in Computer Science, in Boston University, doing research under Prof. Rich West.
- **General free timings to meet can be found here** (Mostly accurate, not set in stone due to the woes of balancing research, coursework, a job, and recreation): https://calendly.com/iyerv-bu 
- Iâ€™m interested in real time systems, operating systems, systems software, firmware, and computer architecture. I like coding at the "low-level" and enjoy intersecting fields.
- I worked in NVIDIA as a systems software engineer, in the GPU firmware team (2021-2024). I did undergrad research (2019-2020) on mixed criticality systems scheduling under Prof. Biju K Raveendran. 
- I also do a ton of art, both on paper with pens, and digitally.
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me via my email, **iyerv@bu.edu** (academic) or **iyervarsha12@gmail.com** (personal).
